### Prerequisites of the Experiment


This experiment requires you to have basic knowledge about :

   - [The Notion of Sorting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sorting_algorithm)

   - [Notion of Time and Space complexity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_complexity)

And above all, a curiosity to learn and explore!


### Overview of the Experiment

- The aim of this experiment is to understand the Bubble Sort algorithm, its time and space complexity, and how it compares against other sorting algorithms.

- The experiment features a series of modules with video lectures, interactive demonstrations, simulations, hands-on practice exercises and quizzes for self analysis.

### Learning Objectives of the Experiment

In this experiment, we will be able to do the following:

   - Given an unsorted array of numbers, generate a sorted array of numbers by applying Bubble Sort.

   - Optimise the Bubble Sort algorithm to achieve better performance.

   - Demonstrate knowledge of time complexity of Bubble Sort by counting the number of operations involved in each iteration.

   - Compare Bubble Sort with other sorting algorithms and realise Bubble Sort as a stable comparison sorting algorithm.
