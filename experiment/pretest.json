      "question": "1. Which of the following represents a homogeneous array (all elements of the same type)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "[1, 4, 3, 10]",
        "b": "['A', 3, 0, \"Hello world\"]",

        "d": "[True, False, 6, 2.5]"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. This is a homogeneous array with all integer elements.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This array contains mixed types (character, integer, and string).",
        "c": "Incorrect. This array contains mixed types (strings, boolean, and character).",
        "d": "Incorrect. This array contains mixed types (boolean, integer, and float)."

        "a": "1, 4, 5, -10",
        "b": "-10, -13, 15, 100",

        "d": "100, 50, 10, 0"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. -10 must appear at the beginning and not the end as it is the smallest element.",
        "b": "Incorrect. -13 is smaller than -10, so they must be swapped.",
        "c": "Correct. This array is properly sorted in ascending order: -1000 < 0 < 14 < 27.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This sequence is in descending order and must be reversed."

        "c": "Merge",
        "d": "Binary"

      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This is a popular sorting algorithm which is covered by this very experiment.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is another popular sorting algorithm.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This is another popular sorting algorithm.",
        "d": "Correct. Binary search is not a sorting algorithm but is in fact an algorithm to search for a specific element in a sorted array."

      "question": "4. Consider the following array: A = [-1, 9, 4, 8] Identify A[2], i.e, the element with index 2 from the following (assume 0-indexed array).",
      "answers": {
        "a": "-1",
        "b": "9",
        "c": "4",
        "d": "8"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. Array indexing begins at 0 and this is the 0th element, i.e, A[0].",
        "b": "Incorrect. Array indexing begins at 0 and this is the element with index 1, i.e, A[1].",
        "c": "Correct. Array indexing begins at 0 and this is the element with index 2, i.e, A[2].",
        "d": "Incorrect. Array indexing begins at 0 and this is the element with index 3, i.e, A[3]."

        "d": "<br>******"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. When i=0, j loops once (0 to 0) printing 1 asterisk. When i=1, j loops twice (0 to 1) printing 2 asterisks. When i=2, j loops three times (0 to 2) printing 3 asterisks.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This output ignores the inner j loop which determines how many asterisks are printed per line.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This output shows reverse order, which would require the loop condition to be different.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This output ignores the newline printing after each iteration of the outer loop."
