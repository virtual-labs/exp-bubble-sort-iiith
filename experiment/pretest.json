      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. This is a valid array with integer elements. Arrays can contain elements of the same or different types.",
        "b": "This is also a valid array containing mixed types (character, integer, and string).",
        "c": "This is also a valid array containing mixed types (strings, boolean, and character).",

      "correctAnswer": "c",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. -10 must appear at the beginning and not the end as it is the smallest element.",
        "b": "Incorrect. -13 is smaller than -10, so they must be swapped.",
        "c": "Correct. This array is properly sorted in ascending order: -1000 < 0 < 14 < 27.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This sequence is in descending order and must be reversed."

      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. When i=0, j loops once (0 to 0) printing 1 asterisk. When i=1, j loops twice (0 to 1) printing 2 asterisks. When i=2, j loops three times (0 to 2) printing 3 asterisks.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This output ignores the inner j loop which determines how many asterisks are printed per line.",
        "c": "Incorrect. This output shows reverse order, which would require the loop condition to be different.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This output ignores the newline printing after each iteration of the outer loop."
