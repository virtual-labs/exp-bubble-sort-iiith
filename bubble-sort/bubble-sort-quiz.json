      "question": "1. Which of the following statements is true (assume ascending sort order)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "After T iterations, atleast T of the smallest elements will be in their correct positions.",
        "b": "After T iterations, atleast T random elements will be in their correct positions.",
        "c": "After T iterations, a random number of elements will be in their correct positions.",
        "d": "After T iterations, atleast T of the largest elements will be in their correct positions."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. In bubble sort (ascending order), the largest elements bubble to the end, not the smallest elements to the beginning.",
        "b": "Incorrect. The elements that reach their correct positions are not random - they follow a specific pattern.",
        "c": "Incorrect. The number of correctly positioned elements after T iterations is predictable, not random.",
        "d": "Correct. In bubble sort for ascending order, after each iteration, the largest remaining element moves to its correct position at the end. After T iterations, at least T of the largest elements will be correctly positioned."

    {
      "question": "2. To sort an array in descending order, when will we swap two adjacent elements under consideration?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "When the ith element is lesser than the (i + 1)th element.",
        "b": "When the ith element is equal to the (i + 1)th element.",
        "c": "When the ith element is greater than the (i + 1)th element.",
        "d": "None of the above."
      },
      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. For descending order, we want larger elements first. If the current element is smaller than the next element, we swap them to move the larger element towards the front.",
        "b": "Incorrect. When elements are equal, no swap is needed as their relative order doesn't matter for sorting.",
        "c": "Incorrect. If the current element is already greater than the next element, they are in the correct order for descending sort.",
        "d": "Incorrect. Option (a) correctly describes when to swap for descending order."

      "question": "3. Consider the following array: <br> A = [9, -1, -10, 9*, 2] <br> Note that the '*' is used to mark a distinction between the two 9's in order to keep track of their order while sorting. Which of the following represents the steps in sorting the above array (assume ascending order)?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "[9, -1, -10, 9*, 2] → [-1, -10, 9, 2, 9*] → [-10, -1, 2, 9, 9*] → [-10, -1, 2, 9, 9*] → [-10, -1, 2, 9, 9*]",
        "b": "[9, -1, -10, 9*, 2] → [-1, -10, 9*, 2, 9] → [-10, -1, 2, 9, 9*] → [-10, -1, 2, 9*, 9] → [-10, -1, 2, 9, 9*]",
        "c": "[9, -1, -10, 9*, 2] → [-1, -10, 2, 9, 9*] → [-10, -1, 2, 9, 9*] → [-10, -1, 2, 9, 9*] → [-10, -1, 2, 9, 9*]",
        "d": "[9, -1, -10, 9*, 2] → [9, -1, 9*, 2, -10] → [9, 9*, 2, -1, -10] → [9, 9*, 2, -1, -10] → [9, 9*, 2, -1, -10]"
      },
      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Incorrect. This shows the original 9 moving before 9*, which violates bubble sort's stability property. Equal elements should maintain their relative order.",
        "b": "Correct. This correctly shows bubble sort maintaining stability - 9* stays before the original 9 throughout the sorting process, and the final sorted array is [-10, -1, 2, 9*, 9].",
        "c": "Incorrect. This skips intermediate steps and doesn't show the proper bubble sort progression. The transitions are too large for single bubble sort iterations.",
        "d": "Incorrect. This shows sorting in the wrong direction (elements moving right instead of being properly sorted in ascending order)."
